Prior to IITGn, I had wonderful experiences serving Hiddenreflex Bangalore.\n\n\nI spent my most beautiful and crucial phase of life at IISC Bangalore. I pursued my M.E. from Computer Science and Automation Department @IISC. I did my thesis in the domain of financial cryptography (with Dr. C. E. Veni Madhavan). Also worked closely in the software engineering field as part of my undergraduate projects in MNIT jaipur.\n\n\nApart from academics, I like dancing, sketching, beatboxing. I have participated in multiple stage performances in my student life.",
