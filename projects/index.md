**Projects** (*The project details will be updated shortly*).

1. Deep image features learning from a single image.
  - Currently working.

2. Block chain and its application to health network
  - 2016, I will put up the report for educational purpose.

3. Digital Signature Primitives for Mobile Payment Systems
  -  Worked on an efficient adaptation of Certi cateless Signcryption and Re-Encryption schemes for NFC-based Mobile Payment Systems. Sponsored project by Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research (IFCPAR). 2013.

4. Feature-Based Approach for Lexical Simplification
  -  Developed an application which simplifies text by replacing hard words with simpler ones. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for classification. 2013.

5. Network Intrusion Detection
  - Created an application which analyses the traffic coming into the network and predicts if the network is suffering from attacks. To train and test the classifier, the DARPA-98 Lincon Laboratory Evaluation Data Set was used. 2012

6. Re-Encryption for Cloud Security
  - Worked on Re-Encryption schemes which provides data security in the cloud. 2012.

7. Quality Adaptive Scheduling for Live streaming over multiple Access Networks
  - 2012, I will put up the report for educational purpose.

8. Universal Hashing for Join Size Estimation of Streaming Data
  - Developed an application which calculates join-size estimation of a continuous data stream. Implemented Fast Agms and Fast Count methods using a 4-universal hash function. 2011.

9. Web Spam Detection
  - Developed an application that classifies a HTML web page as a spam or a legal page using decision tree. The classification process is based on the content of the HTML web page. 2010.
