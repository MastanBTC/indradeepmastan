#### Generative Adversarial Networks
- Currently working.

#### Anonymity Analysis of Bitcoin
- Indra Deep Mastan and Souradyuti Paul, *A New Approach to Deanonymization of Unreachable Bitcoin Nodes*, Cryptography and Network Security (CANS) 2017, Springer, LNCS.

#### Block chain and its application to health network
- 2016

#### Digital Signature Primitives for Mobile Payment Systems
-  Worked on an efficient adaptation of Certi cateless Signcryption and Re-Encryption schemes for NFC-based Mobile Payment Systems. Sponsored project by Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research (IFCPAR). 2013.

#### Feature-Based Approach for Lexical Simplification
-  Developed an application which simplifies text by replacing hard words with simpler ones. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for classification. 2013.

#### Network Intrusion Detection
- Created an application which analyses the traffic coming into the network and predicts if the network is suffering from attacks. To train and test the classifier, the DARPA-98 Lincon Laboratory Evaluation Data Set was used. 2012

#### Re-Encryption for Cloud Security
- Worked on Re-Encryption schemes which provides data security in the cloud. 2012.

#### Quality Adaptive Scheduling for Live streaming over multiple Access Networks
- 2012

#### Universal Hashing for Join Size Estimation of Streaming Data
- Developed an application which calculates join-size estimation of a continuous data stream. Implemented Fast Agms and Fast Count methods using a 4-universal hash function. 2011.

#### Web Spam Detection
- Developed an application that classifies a HTML web page as a spam or a legal page using decision tree. The classification process is based on the content of the HTML web page. 2010.
