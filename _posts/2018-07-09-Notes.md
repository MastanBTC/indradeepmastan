title: Deep Learning Notes.
---
I am preparing documentation for the simple explanation of Deep Learning Topics. I will mostly focus on the Deep Learning [book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. I will also take notes from various websites for educational purpose. Please find the link [here](https://indradeepmastan.github.io/mynotes/)
